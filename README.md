# Rest

> Focused on a local made api directed at: bets, matches.
> Use this as a base for a sdk.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @duque.edits/rest
```

## Usage

```javascript
const { REST } = require("@duque.edits/rest");
const client = new REST();

// Always initiate as it caches users, guilds, bets, matches.

client.init().then(async () => {
  const guild = client.guilds.cache.at("1336809872884371587");
  // In my API, using fetch will automatically create an user if he doesn't exist
  const user = guild.users.fetch("877598927149490186");
  console.log({ user });

  // Reseting users
  client.users.resetAll();
  // Or
  client.betUsers.resetAll();
});
```
